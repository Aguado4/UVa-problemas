# Input: It has 2 parts; the first one is a set of data consisting of
## a code, a space, the locality, a "$", and the price in cents per minute
## (for each line until 000000 is written, then another series of lines
## containing the dialed number and the duration
# Conditions:
# International max=2+3+10=15/min=2+1+4=7, starts with 00
# National max=1+5+7=13/min/1+1+4=6, starts with 0
# Output: For each line, it consists of the dialed number, locality, subscriber number
## (dialed number without the code), duration, price per minute, and the
## total cost of the call (duration*(PPM/100))
