# Programming Problems

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here you will find a collection of programming problems that apply fundamental programming concepts such as data structures, dynamic programming, divide and conquer, backtracking, greedy algorithms, and bisection.

## Introduction

This repository contains a variety of programming problems designed to enhance your understanding and application of basic programming concepts. Each problem is crafted to challenge and improve your problem-solving skills using different algorithmic strategies.

Feel free to browse through the files and try solving the problems.

## Testing Your Solutions

You can test the efficiency and correctness of each algorithm using the [Online Judge](https://onlinejudge.org/). Simply introduce the numbers at the beginning of each problem's name to find the corresponding problem on the Online Judge platform and submit your solution.

For example:
- If the problem file is named `1001-some-problem-name`, you can find problem `1001` on the Online Judge website and test your solution there.

Happy coding! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or contact me directly.
