## Introduction

This repository contains a variety of programming problems designed to enhance your understanding and application of basic programming concepts. Each problem is crafted to challenge and improve your problem-solving skills using different algorithmic strategies.

## Problem List

Below is a list of the problems available in this repository:

1. **[Problem Name 1](link-to-problem)** - Brief description
2. **[Problem Name 2](link-to-problem)** - Brief description
3. **[Problem Name 3](link-to-problem)** - Brief description
4. **Sticks** - Detailed explanation available in the respective file.

Feel free to browse through the files and try solving the problems.

## Testing Your Solutions

You can test the efficiency and correctness of each algorithm using the [Online Judge](https://onlinejudge.org/). Simply introduce the numbers at the beginning of each problem's name to find the corresponding problem on the Online Judge platform and submit your solution.

For example:
- If the problem file is named `1001-some-problem-name`, you can find problem `1001` on the Online Judge website and test your solution there.

**Note**: The problem named "Sticks" is an exception and does not follow this numbering format. However, you are welcome to read through the problem description and try to solve it independently.

Happy coding! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or contact me directly.
